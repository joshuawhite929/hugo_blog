I recently moved my blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) based on a the recommendation of a colleague.  Its been so long since I have written a blog post (2 years!) that I didn't bother to convert my old content.  So far, I am impressed its simplicity.  After a period of time, you really forget what a headache Wordpress really is.
